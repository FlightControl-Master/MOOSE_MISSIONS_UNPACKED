-- Name: TAD-220 - A2G Task Dispatching per TYPE and SCORING
-- Author: FlightControl
-- Date Created: 20 Mar 2017
--
-- # Situation:
-- 
-- This mission demonstrates the scoring of dynamic task dispatching for Air to Ground operations.
-- 
-- # Test cases: 
-- 
-- 1. Observe the FAC(A)'s detecting targets and grouping them. 
-- 2. Check that the HQ provides menus to engage on a task set by the FACs.
-- 3. Engage on a task and destroy a target. Check if scoring is given for that target.
-- 4. Engage all targets in the task, and check if mission success is achieved and that a scoring is given.
-- 5. Restart the mission, and crash into the ground, check if you can get penalties.

-- Now this is REALLY neat. I set the goal of the mission to be the destruction of Target #004.
-- This is just an example, but many more examples can follow...

-- Every time a Task becomes Successful, it will trigger the Complete event in the Mission.
-- The mission designer NEED TO OVERRIDE the OnBeforeComplete to prevent the mission from getting into completion 
-- too early!
