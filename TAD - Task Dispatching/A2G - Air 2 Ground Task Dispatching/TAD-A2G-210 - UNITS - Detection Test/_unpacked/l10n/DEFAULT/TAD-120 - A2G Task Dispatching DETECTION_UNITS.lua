-- Name: TAD-120 - A2G Task Dispatching DETECTION_UNITS
-- Author: FlightControl
-- Date Created: 13 Mar 2017
--
-- # Situation:
-- 
-- This mission demonstrates the dynamic task dispatching for Air to Ground operations.
-- FACA's and FAC's are patrolling around the battle field, while detecting targets.
-- The detection method used is the DETECTION_UNITS method, which groups detected targets per detected unit.
-- 
-- # Test cases: 
-- 
-- 1. Observe the FAC(A)'s detecting targets and grouping them. 
-- 2. Check that the HQ provides menus to engage on a task set by the FACs.
-- 
local HQ = GROUP:FindByName( "HQ", "Bravo HQ" )

local CommandCenter = COMMANDCENTER:New( HQ, "Lima" )

local Scoring = SCORING:New( "Detect Demo" )

local Mission = MISSION
  :New( CommandCenter, "Overlord", "High", "Attack Detect Mission Briefing", coalition.side.RED )
  :AddScoring( Scoring )

local FACSet = SET_GROUP:New():FilterPrefixes( "FAC" ):FilterCoalitions("red"):FilterStart()

local FACAreas = DETECTION_UNITS:New( FACSet )


local AttackGroups = SET_GROUP:New():FilterCoalitions( "red" ):FilterPrefixes( "Attack" ):FilterStart()

TaskDispatcher = TASK_A2G_DISPATCHER:New( Mission, AttackGroups, FACAreas )

-- Now this is REALLY neat. I set the goal of the mission to be the destruction of Target #004.
-- This is just an example, but many more examples can follow...

-- Every time a Task becomes Successful, it will trigger the Complete event in the Mission.
-- The mission designer NEED TO OVERRIDE the OnBeforeComplete to prevent the mission from getting into completion 
-- too early!
